## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Comparing Algorithms

- Understanding Big O notations
    - O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^c) < O(n!)
        - where, c is a constant like 2,3,4 i.e., O(n^2), O(n^3) and so on.
        - and n! is the factorial of n which is the worst time complexity

### Algorithms
